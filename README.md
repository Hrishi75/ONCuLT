A social e-commerce platform for showcasing, buying, and selling event-based merchandise in the Ethereum ecosystem.

This project is a social e-commerce platform built specifically for the Ethereum ecosystem, focused on conferences, meetups, and community events. Many Ethereum events distribute exclusive merchandise such as T-shirts, badges, NFTs, and limited collectibles, but once the event ends, these items lose visibility and have no dedicated place to be showcased or traded. At the same time, many community members are unable to attend events due to location, cost, or time constraints and miss out on both the experience and the merchandise.
The platform solves this by combining social features with a marketplace. Users can create profiles, showcase the items they collected at Ethereum events, post updates to a social feed, and list merchandise or collectibles for sale directly from their profiles or posts. Other users can explore event-based collections, discover what attendees received, and purchase items using Ethereum wallet authentication and on-chain transactions.
Event hosts can also showcase official merchandise, run limited drops, and extend engagement beyond the event itself. The long-term vision is to evolve this into an interactive ecosystem with peer-to-peer trading, event check-ins, and gamified collectibles that strengthen Ethereum community culture and digital ownership.
